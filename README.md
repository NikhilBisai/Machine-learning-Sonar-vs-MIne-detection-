 ML Sonar vs Mine ðŸ§ ðŸ’£

A Machine Learning project to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines using various supervised algorithms. Built with an emphasis on data preprocessing, model comparison, and evaluation techniques.

##  Project Overview

This project tackles a binary classification problem: distinguishing between sonar returns from metal cylinders (mines) and rocks. Using a public dataset, the goal is to evaluate different classification algorithms for performance, interpretability, and deployment readiness.

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Implementation Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Visualizations, null value checks, label encoding
2. **Model Building**: Used Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
3. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Cross-validation
4. **Feature Importance**: Identified key features influencing predictions

##  Results

- Best model achieved an accuracy of **89%** using Linear regression model
- Insights drawn from feature importance improved understanding of sonar characteristics
